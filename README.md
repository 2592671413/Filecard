## Setup
You can just grab yourself a stable, operational copy of the application that launches and then later disperses itself completely by unpacking in the C:/temp/ directory. This only applies for Windows.

You can just download either amd64 or x32 binary that also contains everything you need to set up a permanent installation of the application on your machine.
